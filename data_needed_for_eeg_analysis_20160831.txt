Information required for analysis of EEG

must-have information:
1. sampling rate
2. hardware filter setting (filter type, filtered range)
3. software filter setting (filter type, filtered range)
4. unit of voltage measurement (mostly microvolt)
5. electrode position
6. position of ground electrode
7. resistance at each electrode
8. amplifier setting 
9. arrays of voltage measurement at each electrode

* it would be easier if the exported EEG measurement is a plain text file with the above information provided. Otherwise, specification of binary data format or loading program
is needed for analysis in MATLAB or other tools.

I personally use MATLAB for analysis, and some open source loaders are provided by the community (http://pub.ist.ac.at/~schloegl/matlab/eeg/).If the data provided already have open source loaders, we can directly use these built programs to load binary data.

* I found specification of data provided by Garmin manufactured equipments. It would be a lot easier if the engineers export the data for us, or at least provide type of record.
